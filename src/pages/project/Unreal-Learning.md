Learning a new skill can be a tricky process. Around the fall of every year I try to advance my development skills and learn a technology/skill. This year's being learning Unreal Engine. An incredibily popular tool for graphics and video game development. With the end goal to build a small game by the end of the year.

Currently, I am still in the tutorial stage of my learning and am hoping to also launch a blog on my experiences with learning Unreal. One of the goals is to release all my prototypes/ "finished" games to Itch.io and collect some feedback. After only working with no side projects for the last 9 months, it is nice to be learning again and especially nice to work again in Cpp.
