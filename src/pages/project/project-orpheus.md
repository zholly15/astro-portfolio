As a project while at Seattle University I worked on what we called Project Orpheus. The goal of this full stack application
was to provide the social experience found on Twitter, BeReal and instagram but through the lens of shared music experiences.

Users were able to create accounts where they could then store music collections. Not just collections of songs but also collections of albums. These collections could also be shared with other users or promoted on users profiles. We also began
to expand usage of the Spotify API to include Tune In Time that would function as social feature to share what you were listening to at the given moment of time. We also built a promoted music section to allow users continued discovery of
music that matched their tastes.

Project Orpheus is a full stack web application that was deployed on Azure. The front end being built in Angular, Middleware in Node.JS and finally the backend being built with MongoDB. OAuth was being handled by the Google API and the Spotify API. 
Spotify API was also utilized to grab music data initially and populate our dataservices.

Overall this project was a great way of learning while doing. By building a full stack application in just a short 10 weeks, we were able to learn how to scope down delieverables and be better engineers. It also provided me a unique opportunity to lead a project and learn more about the management side of software engineering.
